**Notes:**

Due to time constraints, we weren't able to fully implement validations on these APIs. Currently, these APIs only perform minimal checking and may show unexpected behaviors. It is suggested to use provided front-end interfaces learn how these APIs work. Implementing full input validation is part of our next milestone.
